It is a Computer Vision Based Attendance System with facial recognition., As of now 
we are taking the manual attendance to mark as present or absent. But all have to update with 
the technology that can make anyone’s work easy and accurate. In search of best things face 
recognition which cannot be masked can be used for attendance purpose accurately which helps 
the faculty to reduce their work and with less errors. 
A facial recognition attendance system uses facial recognition technology to identify 
and verify a person using the person's facial features and automatically mark attendance. The 
software can be used for different groups of people such as employees, students, etc. 
Entry and exit time monitoring done manually or with other biometric systems can be 
fully automated with facial recognition attendance systems. Pandemic like Covid 19 can be 
better managed by minimizing physical contact in public places and work environments. 
Systems like True in make use of mobile devices for time and attendance using facial 
recognition. Facial recognition systems are the best modern-day solution for tracking employee 
hours.

A python GUI integrated attendance system using face recognition to take attendance.

In this python project, I have made an attendance system which takes attendance by using face recognition technique. I have also intergrated it with GUI (Graphical user interface) so it can be easy to use by anyone. GUI for this project is also made on python using tkinter.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
1) tkinter for whole GUI
2) OpenCV for taking images and face recognition (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
3) CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime etc. for other purposes.

FEATURES:
1) Easy to use with interactive GUI support.
2) Password protection for new person registration.
3) Creates/Updates CSV file for deatils of students on registration.
4) Creates a new CSV file everyday for attendance and marks attendance with proper date and time.
5) Displays live attendance updates for the day on the main screen in tabular format with Id, name, date and time.
